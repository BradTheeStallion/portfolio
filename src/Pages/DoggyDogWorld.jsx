      <p>Iâ€™m especially proud of this one because it was my first project using React. This was the third QAP from my second semester of school. The assignment was direct: we connect to an API and fetch a range of up to 100 pictures of a specific dog breed.</p>
      <p>This was a fun project, so I thought the style should be a little playful. I hope you enjoy Doggy Dog World!</p>
