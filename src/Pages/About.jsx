                        <p>Hello! I’m Brad, a software development student at Keyin College in St. John’s, Newfoundland.</p>
                        <p>I've been studying Python and JavaScript for the past 8 months and have recently gotten into React, taking full advantage of the tools I've learned to put together this portfolio.</p>
                        <p>My studies so far have focused on frontend development, but I am very excited to dive deeper into backend and learn Java next semester.</p>
                        <p>I make an effort to attend networking events here in St. John's. Hopefully I'll see you at the next Hackathon!</p>

                        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
                        <p>This portfolio began as part of my final project for Semester 2 of my program.</p>
                        <p>It has since evolved into a place where I can showcase my projects and skills as a developer.</p>
                        <p>I started this portfolio keeping principles of test-driven development in mind and plan to continue testing new components as I add them.</p>
                        <p>Feel free to take a look around and check out my projects!</p>
                        <p>My contact information is in the footer, please don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
